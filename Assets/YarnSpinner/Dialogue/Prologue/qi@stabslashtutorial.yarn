GuenueQi: Mun! You made it, was wondering when you were gonna show up. #mood:smoking
Guenue Qi: It’s not like you to be late to a lesson, but uh, I don’t remember planning for all this to happen...
Mun: Apologies for the delay, Blademistress Qi.
Guenue Qi: Hey, it's fine. It's nice not being the late one for a change.
Guenue Qi: Anyway! We're gonna run you through the basics. You must always stay on top of your fundies, after all.
Mun: ...Fundies?
Guenue Qi: Fundamentals. Aren't you supposed to be my best student?
Mun: Right. As you say, Blademistress Qi.

Guenue Qi: I'm going to make a bunch of dummies for you to test your skills on.
Guenue Qi: Some enemies you encounter will be weak to your slashes, others will be weak to your piercing attacks.
Guenue Qi: A skilled combatant will be able to identify the weaknesses of their enemies and take advantage of them.

Guenue Qi: Nice form!
Guenue Qi: You'll find that enemies weak to slashing will often have an X somewhere on their person.
Guenue Qi: Look for places to slash and hack at their weak areas.
Guenue Qi: Onto the next...

Guenue Qi: Well done.
Guenue Qi: Enemies weak to Piercing will often have an O somewhere on their person.
Guenue Qi: You'll need to place your thrusts decisively in order to defeat your foes.
Guenue Qi: Now then.

Mun: I don't remember this dojo being quite so... big.
Guenue Qi: Dunno what you're talking about, maybe you just haven't been paying enough attention, my student.
Mun: ...I'm not so sure about that, Blademistress Qi.

Guenue Qi: You know, Mun. I've never had any of my students get through that course quite that confidently.
Guenue Qi: It's as if you were running through the motions...
Guenue Qi: You never done this before, have you?
Guenue Qi: Well.
Guenue Qi: Anyway.
Guenue Qi: Now it's time for the next part of your training.
Guenue Qi: You will spar with me. I'd like to see how your skills have developed first-hand.
